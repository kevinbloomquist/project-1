Hello!

	Thank you for playing "SIMPLE SIMON". Below is a living document describing the assignment, approaches to and reflections on the process as I worked through the project, problems as yet unsolved, and  some working ideas for future versions. Your feedback is welcome and would be very much appreciated so please feel free to reach out.

	Have fun!

#Project #1: The Game

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between two players
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

### Approaches and Reflections

The project is written mainly using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. you'l notice a little Underscore JS and JQuery sprinkled in, either as a shortcut or as a workaround to a problem.

I wanted to make a game that felt clean, familiar yet new, and simple. I wanted it to have a comfortable yet challenging feel. I also wanted it to have functionality that you were drawn to and want to interact with.
I also wanted to explore alternative progress metrics (in this first version that takes the form of background color).

The backbone of the game is based largely on the generation of a random array of values 1-4. Each value steers a switch to trigger CSS changes in html divs that constitute the game board. Once the sequence has ended the player can then try to emulate the sequence which generates a response array. When the length of the response array equals that of the sequence array (useArray) the two are compared for accuracy and the player is alerted of his/her success. Then the sequence is extended by one more random number and the cycle repeats.

* challenge climax: Timing/ timer issues.

*Major takeaways/Concepts so far:

- Breadcrumbs!!! I appreciated the utility of console.logging before this project but through this process I really refined the art of logging and gained a better understanding of exactly where to place and how to label the log to best express what is happening in the document flow.

- Noticed meta-patterns in workflow, style, and problem solving rituals.
i.e. Quarantine/block technique

- Document flow and scope (more detailed understanding)

*This project is great for:
- Working with and comparing Arrays
- Understanding timers and document flow
- Working with random values

*Current working through/hope to add:

Style:
- Change alerts to modals
- Animations/ ctx landing (opening sequence) and index (round change bullet line)
- funesse color pallete
- ability to change themes

Function:
- Add multiple players
- box color complement transitions (difficulty)

Organization:
- clean up and DRY code out

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
